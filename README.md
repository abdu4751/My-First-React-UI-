<h1>🚀 My-First-React-UI</h1> 

This is my first React project, focused on building a clean and responsive user interface using reusable components. It does not include any logic or interactivity — the goal was to explore React fundamentals like components, import/export, and layout structure.

 <h1>🧩 Features</h1>
- ⚛️ Built with React
- 📱 Fully responsive design
- 🧱 Multiple UI components (e.g. product cards, layout grids)
❌ No backend or dynamic logic

<h1>🎯 Purpose</h1>
This project helped me:
- Understand how to structure components
- Practice import/export in React
- Build a layout that works across devices
- Push a clean front-end project to GitHub
