<h1>🚀 My-First-React-UI</h1> 

This is my first React project, focused on building a clean and responsive user interface using reusable components. It does not include any logic or interactivity — the goal was to explore React fundamentals like components, import/export, and layout structure. <br>

 <h1>🧩 Features</h1>
 
- ⚛️ Built with React <br>
- 📱 Fully responsive design <br>
- 🧱 Multiple UI components (e.g. product cards, layout grids) <br>
❌ No backend or dynamic logic <br>

<h1>🎯 Purpose</h1>

This project helped me:
- Understand how to structure components <br>
- Practice import/export in React <br>
- Build a layout that works across devices <br>
- Push a clean front-end project to GitHub <br>
